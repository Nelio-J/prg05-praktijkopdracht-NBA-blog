        <p>The burning question entering Tuesday’s contest between the Lakers and the Thunder was
            whether LeBron James could score the 36 points he needed to finally break Kareem
            Abdul-Jabbar’s career NBA scoring record.</p>
        <p>In true LeBron fashion, he didn’t even need a full game.</p>
        <p>James sank a 21-foot turnaround with 10.9 seconds left in the third quarter at Crypto.com
            Arena, giving him 16 points in the period, the necessary 36 for the game and 38,388 for his
            illustrious career — now more than any other player in NBA history.</p>
        <p>LeBron James: Making History
        <p>“I never thought anybody could beat Kareem’s record,” Magic Johnson said during a
            congratulatory clip, speaking for most NBA observers.</p>
        <p>That includes James, who said in the run-up to Tuesday’s game that he never seriously
            contemplated besting Abdul-Jabbar’s record until recently given how unreachable it felt.</p>
        <p>But James, who also played multiple stints in Cleveland bracketing a stretch in Miami, has
            followed the same path as his fellow Lakers star with consistent, high-level excellence and
            historic longevity. With double-figure points in all but eight career games, and scoring
            averages of at least 25 points per game in all 19 seasons since his rookie campaign in
            2003-04, James consistently chipped away at the standard Abdul-Jabbar initially set in 1984
            and continued to build on until his retirement in 1989.</p>
        <p>“Congratulations to LeBron on breaking one of the most hallowed records in all of sports by
            becoming the NBA’s all-time scoring leader,” NBA commissioner Adam Silver said via
            statement. “It’s a towering achievement that speaks to his sustained excellence over 20
            seasons in the league. And quite amazingly, LeBron continues to play at an elite level and
            his basketball history is still being written.”</p>
